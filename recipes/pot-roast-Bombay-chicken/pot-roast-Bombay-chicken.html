    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><p>Heat oven to 220C/200C fan/gas 6.</p><p>Put the chicken on a chopping board and, using your hands, rub the skin generously with half the spice paste.</p><p>Season well, tie the legs together and set aside.</p></li>
            <li><p>Heat the oil in a large flameproof casserole dish over a medium heat. Add the onion and a good pinch of salt and cook for 5 mins or until beginning to soften.</p>
                <p>Add the tomatoes, fenugreek seeds, ginger and remaining spice paste, and cook for 3 mins more. Stir through the coconut milk and bring to a simmer.</p>
                <p>Add the chicken and the potatoes to the dish, and cook in the oven for 20 mins, uncovered.</p></li>
            <li><p>Lower the heat to 180C/160C fan/ gas 4 and cook for 55 mins more.</p>
                <p>Check that the meat is cooked by cutting through one of its legs – the flesh shouldn’t be pink.</p></li>    
            <li><p>Remove the chicken and place on a chopping board.Stir the spinach through the sauce and leave to rest for 5 mins.</p>
                <p>Put the chicken back in the dish, top with the coriander and carve at the table. Serve with poppadums and chutney, if you like.</p></li>
