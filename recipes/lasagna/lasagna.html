<h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><p>Heat the oil in a large deep frying pan over a medium-high heat, then fry the prosciutto until crisp.</p><p>Transfer to a plate using a slotted spoon.</p></li>
            <li><p>For the meat sauce, add the celery and onion to the pan with a pinch of salt and pepper; cook until soft (about 10 minutes). Add the garlic and cook for another minute.</p>
                <p>Add the mince and fry for 4-5 minutes, breaking up with a wooden spoon, until browned. Stir in the tomato purée and chopped tomatoes; cook for another minute.</p>
                <p>Add the stock and simmer for 30 minutes over a low-medium heat until the sauce has thickened.</p>
                <p>Remove from the heat, season with salt and pepper, then stir in the fried prosciutto, chopped oregano and most of the basil leaves.</p></li>
            <li><p>For the béchamel sauce, heat the butter in a medium heavy-based saucepan over a medium-high heat. Add the flour and stir constantly for 3-4 minutes until the mixture starts to smell biscuity.</p>
                <p>Slowly pour in the milk, whisking all the time, for 6-8 minutes until the sauce has thickened.</p>
                <p>Remove from the heat, stir in 20g of the parmesan and all the nutmeg, then season well with salt and pepper. Heat the oven to 200°C/180°C fan/gas 6.</p></li>    
            <li><p>To assemble, spread a little of the béchamel sauce over the base of the baking dish, then cover with slightly overlapping lasagne sheets.</p>
                <p>Pour over a third of the remaining white sauce, sprinkle over a little of the grated cheese and top with half the meat sauce.</p>
                <p>Cover with another layer of lasagne sheets, top with half the remaining white sauce, then all the remaining red sauce.</p>
                <p>Add the final layer of lasagne sheets, then spread with the rest of the white sauce. Scatter with the remaining grated cheese.</p></li>
            <li><p>Bake the lasagne for 35-40 minutes until golden and bubbling. Serve garnished with the remaining basil.</p></li>
